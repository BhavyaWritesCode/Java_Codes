# Mastering Java

Hello, fellow internet human! üëã

What you'll see below is a log for every program I have done to Make my Java Stronger . ( The Log Keep Updating With More Content)

## Basic Syntax and Data Types üê£
| Serial No                       | Name                                                                                                              |    Description

|    1    | Hello World |       The gateway to the coding universe! üöÄ Your very first step into the world of programming‚Äîwhere it all begins.                                        |
|    2    | Declaring Variables |       The foundation of every program! Learn how to store and manipulate data using variables ‚Äì the building blocks of Java.                          |
|    3    | Type Casting  |       Transforming data like a pro! Learn how to convert one data type into another‚Äîbecause sometimes, even Java needs a little flexibility.      |
|    4    | Swapping of two variables |       Implemented a smart swapping technique using arithmetic eliminating the need for a third variable and optimizing memory usage.                          |
|    5    | Sum of N Natural Number |       Implemented an optimized approach to calculate the sum of the first N natural numbers using loop-based iteration                          |
|    6    | Arithmetic Operations |       Implemented a program to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus) on two numbers.                          |
|    7    | Calculating the Area of Different Shapes |         Implemented a program that finds the area of a circle, rectangle, and triangle based on user input.                      |
|    8    | Calculating String length |         Implemented a program to get a String from the user and find it's length Without using length() Method.                     |

|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
|    9    | Factorial of a Number  |         Implemented a program to Calculate the Factorial of a number after taking input from the User.                  |
|    10    | Checking if number is positive or not |         Implemented a program to check if a number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else conditions.                     |
|    11    | Checking Sum of odd or even number  |         Implemented a program to calculate the sum of the odd and even numbers between the given range.                      |
|    12    | Fibonacci Series  |         Implemented a program to calculate the Fibonacci series with given number provided.                      |
|    13    | Switch Case  |         Implemented a program using Switch Case method to determine the day of the week based on a number input.                      |
|    14    | FIZZ BUZZ  |         Implemented a program which replaces multiples of 3 
with "Fizz" and multiples of 5 with "Buzz." If a number is divisible by both,then print "FizzBuzz."                       |
|    15    | Palindrome  |         Implemented a program to check whether the number is palindrome or not                      |
|    16    | Armstrong  |         Implemented a program to check whether the number is Armstrong or not                      |
|    17    | Strong |         Implemented a program to check whether the number is Strong or not                      |
|    18    | Decimal to Binary  |         Implemented a program to Convert the Decimal Number into the binary format                       |
|    19    | ASCII values  |         Implemented a program to Convert Lowercase letters into Uppercase and Vice-versa using ASCII values                       |
